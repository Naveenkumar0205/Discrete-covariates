# Discrete Covariates

The data set rent_index_99.csv1 contains rent index data for Munich collected in 1999. It contains information about the net rent and 6 other covariates for a total of 3082 apartments in Munich. The covariates include:
 • size of the living area (i.e. the apartment’s size) in square meters;
 • construction year;
 • quality of the bathroom (0 standard, 1 premium);
 • quality of the kitchen (0 standard, 1 premium);
 • quality of the location (1 average location, 2 good location, 3 top location);
 • central heating (1 yes, 0 no).

# Tasks
  1. Determine whether the quality of the location has a significant effect on the rent per squaremeter. Put special emphasis on the decision whether to use a parametric (ANOVA) or nonparametric (rank-based) method.
  2. Are there pairwise differences between the rent per square meter for different location qualities? Consider all pairs of location qualities and conduct two-sample tests. Use appropriate methods to adjust for multiple testing. Interpret the results. Compare the results derived with and without adjustments for multiple testing.
